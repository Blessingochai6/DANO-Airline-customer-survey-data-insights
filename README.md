## INTODUCTION
This is a Power BI project on the analysis of a survey data of **DANO** airline, the project is to analyze the survey data and find the key areas to focus and improve on for the Airline to get back on track

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The latest passenger survey results for DANO Airlines, a Uk-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom just came in, and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever.

## DATA ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS
I created a pivot table for each of the columns in order to analyze and ascertain the frequency of the ratings for each the subject matter in each column. I imputed charts that would provide a very clear and concise interpretation of the data.

## BASIC SUMMARY OF DATA
- The total number of customers is 129,881
- The percentage for returning customers is 82% as against the 18% of first time customers
- 69% of the customers patronized the airline for business travels while the remaining 31% was for personal travels
- The average age of customers is 39 years, which implies that most of the customers of DANO Airline are in their late 30s and early 40s

**_From the analysis of the data I was able to deduce the major factors that impacted the customersâ€™ survey negatively, and they include:_**

A.	Ease online booking: this is a very important factor for most of the customers that attempted to secure their bookings on the airline website probably because they want to avoid the long queues or they were hoping to save time for other things while utilizing the option of booking online. This dissatisfaction may have stemmed from the online tools for booking not being user-friendly, which could potentially create frustration in the customers and in their ability to book online

B.	Departure and arrival time convenience: Majority of the customers gave a poor rating on this point. This is because most of the customers are individuals on business trip, as a result the departure and arrival time does not give them the  opportunity to  meet up with their business meetings or activities conveniently
	
C.	In-flight WIFI Service: In-flight WIFI service was also an important factor, because most of the customers may have been on a long distance trip,so the in-flight WIFI service is a medium of entertainment. Also they could leverage the In-flight WIFI service to attend business meetings online but the inefficiency of the service makes it frustrating for customers and so they are unable to enjoy their flight
D.	Gate Location :a lot of the customers who may have been travelling with huge luggage found it really stressful to locate the airline gate thereby posing a lot of frustration for the customers
**Other not so obvious factors include check-in service, online boarding, food and drinks and cleanliness**

## RECOMMENDATIONS
- Effort should be canned into improving the online booking tool, making it user-friendly to create a satisfying experience for the customers 
- The airline should try as much as possible to adhere to the departure and arrival time, if there would be possible delays at any of these times, customers should be promptly notified earlier to enable them make sufficient adjustments to their time and expectations
- In-flight WIFI service should be improved upon to enable customers have a relaxing experience especially for customers that are travelling long distances
- Also the management of the airline should look into the possibility of relocating the airline gate to improving the ease of access to the customers
